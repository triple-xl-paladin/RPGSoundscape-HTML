# RPGSoundscape-HTML
Exactly the same as the RPG Soundscape, but designed to be run in the web browser. RPG Soundscape is an ambiance
music and effects player. This program is not a soundboard.

## What is RPG Soundscape and what problem does it solve?
RPG Soundscape is designed to support a Game Master (GM) in running a tabletop role playing game (RPG) such 
as Dungeons and Dragons. The program gives the game master the opportunity to provide some ambiant music 
and sound effects (background sound effects) during game play. The program runs a set of music files determined
by the game master and if the game master chooses, they can run some sound effects as well. For example, players
enter a tavern. The game master can play tavern type music with the sound effects of crowd. The program is meant
to be lightweight for the game master.

## How can I use my own music and sound effects?
This version is intended to be run in the browser. Creating personal soundsets requires changing the javascript
JSON variable in js/soundscapes.js


I am releasing this program under GPL v3.0.

Have fun!
